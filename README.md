# Python Graph Cycle Detection

Simple program written to implement a cycle/deadlock detection algorithm from Modern Operating Systems, 4th edition, by Tanenbaum (Chapter 6, pg. 445).

Below is the corresponding image of the graph. The left graph shows the original. The right graph shows the reduced, identified cycle.

The reduced holt graph on the right would be used to identify deadlock.
